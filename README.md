> **"Turn your daily chores into an epic adventure."**

**Sidequest** is a gamified productivity app built with **Flutter**. It transforms mundane daily tasks into RPG-style "contracts," rewarding users with XP, streaks, and rank progression. Designed with a sleek, dark **Glassmorphism UI** inspired by dark fantasy games (The Witcher), it helps users build habits in Fitness, Knowledge, Mindfulness, and Creativity.
